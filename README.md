# Titanic Model

Here I train different machine learning models to predict which titanic passenger survived the desaster.
The best performing model will be submitted to the Kaggle Titanic Challenge.

## Structure
* `/data/`: contains train, test and submission datasets. `csv`-Files have been adden to `.gitignore`
* `/notebooks/`:
    * __DummyClassifier__: Solution to one of the cource challenges from the beginning of the week.
    * __foooor_kaaaggleeeee__: contains some code I wrote while feature engineering and testing.
    * __Logistic Regression Model__: First feature engineering steps while following the livecoding session
    * __kaggle_submission__: polished notebook combining _preprocessing, cleaning, feature engineering, cross validation, predicting_ and creating a submission file for kaggle
